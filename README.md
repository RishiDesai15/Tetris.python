**Game Description:**
**Objective:**
The goal of Tetris is to manipulate falling blocks, known as Tetriminos, to create complete horizontal lines without any gaps. When a line is completed, it disappears, and the player scores points. The game ends when the blocks reach the top of the screen.

**Game Elements:**
Tetriminos: Seven different shapes made up of four squares each. The player can rotate and move them horizontally as they fall.
Game Board: A grid where Tetriminos fall. The goal is to complete horizontal lines to clear them.
Score System: Points are awarded for each cleared line, and additional points may be awarded for clearing multiple lines simultaneously.

**Game Dynamics:**
Tetriminos fall from the top of the screen one at a time, and the player must move and rotate them to fit into gaps on the board.
When a line is complete, it disappears, and any blocks above it move down to fill the gap.
As the game progresses, Tetriminos fall faster, increasing the difficulty.

**Learning Opportunities:**

**Data Structures:**
Utilize 2D arrays or lists to represent and manipulate the game board.
Implement data structures to represent Tetriminos and their rotations.

**User Input Handling:**
Captured and processed user input for moving Tetriminos left, right, rotating them, and making them fall faster.

**Game Loop:**
Implemented a game loop to handle continuous updates, such as moving Tetriminos down at regular intervals.

**Collision Detection:**
Developed algorithms to detect collisions between Tetriminos and the game board or other Tetriminos.

**Randomization:**
Used randomization to generate different Tetriminos for each turn.

**Scoring System:**
Designed and implemented a scoring system that rewards players for clearing lines and achieving more difficult maneuvers.

**Graphics and Animation:**
Used libraries like Pygame to create a graphical user interface with animations for falling Tetriminos and line clearing.

**Game Over Handling:**
Implemented logic to detect when the game is over, and display appropriate messages or options for restarting.

**Testing and Debugging:**
Practiced testing and debugging skills, especially dealing with complex interactions between different game components.
